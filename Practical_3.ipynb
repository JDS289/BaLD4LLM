While many relationships are non-linear in nature it is often challenging to interpret and explain the results from non-linear models. Therefore, linear models remains very important as they provide a nice trade-off between explanation of the data while at the same time providing interpretable semantics.\n"

        "This has been quite a short introduction to a set of very useful models. We have cut quite a few corners theoretically but importantly this is something that we have to do when working as data-scientist. We need to be able to apply models while there is still some uncertainty in how they work and be able to translate this uncertainty to how we interpret the results that we get. You are by no means expected to be experts on GLMs at all but you should be able to use them.\n",

        "The next part of your challenge is now to include the models that we have built up and use them in the coursework. Try to first visualise the data, make a clear narrative of why you are selecting a specific model and try to use the tools that we derived her in order to provide context to the predictions that you make. The statsmodel package gives you a rich set of tools that you should be able to include directly into your project. Importantly, remember that the most important thing is to be able to say why a model does what it does not necessarily choosing the right model.\n",

        "During the lecture Neil mentioned the idea that what separates statisticians from machine learners is that the former cares about β while the machine learners cares about $\\hat{y}$ (the predictions). If you look at the statmodels package this concept becomes very clear. Using the GLM code as we did in the first exercise doesn’t actually provide us with the uncertainty in the predictions only in the parameters. It was because of this we changed from the GLM model class to OLS when using the basis functions."
